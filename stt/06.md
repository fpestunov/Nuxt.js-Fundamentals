00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:05.245
In the previous video
we added our global style rules,

2
00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:06.929
in the default layout.

3
00:00:06.971 --> 00:00:11.533
The layouts in Nuxt are used to define
the layout of the application.

4
00:00:11.716 --> 00:00:15.122
For example, you might have
a full-width layout,

5
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:16.725
and one with the sidebar.

6
00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:19.604
So, even though you would use
two layouts,

7
00:00:19.643 --> 00:00:22.246
they will most likely share
the same global styles,

8
00:00:22.408 --> 00:00:25.814
like the default font sizes,
the margins, and so on.

9
00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:29.496
If we put these global styles
in the layout components,

10
00:00:29.552 --> 00:00:31.399
we will have to duplicate them.

11
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:35.474
To prevent that,
Nuxt allows us to define global css,

12
00:00:35.542 --> 00:00:38.133
that will be used in all pages
and layouts.

13
00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:40.626
Let's see how we can do that.

14
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:46.213
Inside the nuxt configuration file
there is an option called css,

15
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:50.262
that accepts an array with the paths
of the css files to make global.

16
00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:53.904
If you have a css file
in the assets directory,

17
00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:59.077
the path will be ~
and then /assets/ the name of the file.

18
00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:03.776
The ~ here is an alias for the root
directory coming from Nuxt.

19
00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:06.925
Notice here that you can have
your global css files

20
00:01:07.064 --> 00:01:09.462
anywhere outside
of the assets directory,

21
00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:10.643
if you want to.

22
00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:13.714
You can have for example
a root styles directory,

23
00:01:13.813 --> 00:01:17.033
or even reference the stylesheet
of a package you are using.

24
00:01:17.256 --> 00:01:18.980
Let me show you an example.

25
00:01:19.184 --> 00:01:21.554
Here, there are 3 global stylesheets.

26
00:01:21.657 --> 00:01:25.180
The first one lives in an npm module,
called bulma.

27
00:01:25.374 --> 00:01:28.442
The second one,
is a css file in the project,

28
00:01:28.548 --> 00:01:30.169
like the one I showed you.

29
00:01:30.376 --> 00:01:34.428
The last file is also in the project
but it's a scss file.

30
00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:38.080
Nuxt will automatically guess
the file type by its extension,

31
00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:40.343
and use the appropriate pre-processor.

32
00:01:40.553 --> 00:01:43.453
Know that you have to install
the necessary webpack loaders,

33
00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:45.218
if you want to use this feature.

34
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:47.674
Ok, back to our project,

35
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.915
I will create a css file
under the assets directory,

36
00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:54.345
and I will paste the rules
we used in the default layout here.

37
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.849
Now, I will go on the config file
and make it global.

38
00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:06.745
Let's give it a shot in the browser.

39
00:02:07.352 --> 00:02:09.161
It seems that it doesn't work.

40
00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.488
Though, every time you make changes
in the nuxt configuration file,

41
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.508
you have to restart
the development server,

42
00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:17.700
in order for the changes
to take effect.

43
00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:23.373
Now, when I refresh,
our pages have the desired style,

44
00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:26.471
and from now on,
if we create multiple layouts,

45
00:02:26.564 --> 00:02:29.464
we won't need to repeat
the global style rules.
