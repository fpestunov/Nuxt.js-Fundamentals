1
00:00:02.157 --> 00:00:05.389
Nuxt project comes
with vuex support out of the box.

2
00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:09.052
Of course it is not mandatory
to use vuex in your application,

3
00:00:09.148 --> 00:00:10.297
if you don't want to.

4
00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:13.735
In this video we are not going
to cover what Vuex is,

5
00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:14.900
and how to use it.

6
00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:18.391
If you want to learn that,
check out our Vuex course,

7
00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:19.467
which is free.

8
00:00:19.968 --> 00:00:22.795
That being said, feel free to jump
into the next lesson,

9
00:00:22.903 --> 00:00:25.448
if you are not interested
in implementing Vuex.

10
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.578
Okay! Nuxt offers 2 modes to use Vuex.

11
00:00:30.813 --> 00:00:33.310
The classic mode and the modules mode.

12
00:00:33.543 --> 00:00:37.252
The classic mode is a global store
that includes everything.

13
00:00:37.472 --> 00:00:42.175
the modules mode, as its name tells,
let us work with Vuex modules.

14
00:00:42.414 --> 00:00:46.264
The beauty in Nuxt is that all
it takes to get started with Vuex,

15
00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:48.647
is to create one file
in the store directory,

16
00:00:48.711 --> 00:00:50.032
for the classic mode.

17
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:52.174
Remember that it's always worth it,

18
00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:54.699
to use vuex modules
for maintainability.

19
00:00:54.938 --> 00:00:58.127
For this mode we have to create
an index.js file,

20
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.424
and a file for each module we need.

21
00:01:00.672 --> 00:01:02.745
Nuxt will parse these files,

22
00:01:02.837 --> 00:01:05.335
and it will automagically create
our full blown store,

23
00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:06.630
that will look like that.

24
00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:08.866
Let's do that.

25
00:01:09.752 --> 00:01:11.869
I will start
by creating the index file.

26
00:01:14.498 --> 00:01:16.831
One difference
from using Vuex normally,

27
00:01:16.858 --> 00:01:20.579
is that we have to export each asset
instead of a whole store instance.

28
00:01:21.257 --> 00:01:25.721
So, if we need some state and getters,
we will export these 2 constants.

29
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.291
The same for the actions
and mutations.

30
00:01:29.802 --> 00:01:33.481
Another difference,
is that the state has to be a function

31
00:01:33.584 --> 00:01:35.324
that returns the actual object.

32
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.200
I will leave the global state empty
and I will create a posts module,

33
00:01:39.316 --> 00:01:41.977
to store the posts
we used in our post page.

34
00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:44.805
Here, the name of the file
is the name of the module.

35
00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:46.656
As we just learned,

36
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:50.123
I will create the state function
that will return our state object.

37
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.775
I will add a property all
and move our posts array here.

38
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:02.672
Sweet!

39
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.419
For our simple example,

40
00:02:04.554 --> 00:02:06.857
we don't need getters,
mutations or actions.

41
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.361
So, we can move on,

42
00:02:08.452 --> 00:02:10.618
and use the Vuex store
we just created.

43
00:02:10.846 --> 00:02:13.053
To confirm that it's set up
as expected,

44
00:02:13.164 --> 00:02:15.393
you can always consult
the Vue Devtools.

45
00:02:16.628 --> 00:02:18.416
No Vuex store detected.

46
00:02:18.952 --> 00:02:21.925
That's because we have to restart
our development server,

47
00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:24.405
in order for Nuxt to activate Vuex.

48
00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.314
Now we can see our posts array
that lives in the all property,

49
00:02:29.413 --> 00:02:30.876
under the posts module.

50
00:02:31.053 --> 00:02:32.093
Awesome!

51
00:02:35.037 --> 00:02:38.449
Let's use the posts coming
from the store in our component.

52
00:02:38.743 --> 00:02:42.320
Here, we used to access
the posts under this.posts.

53
00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:44.764
Now, we have to access the store.

54
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.880
Nuxt has automatically injected
the store into all components.

55
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.873
So, we can use this.$store,
then navigate to the state,

56
00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:55.477
then the posts module,

57
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:58.612
and grab all the posts
that live in the all property.

58
00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:00.034
Great!

59
00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:03.034
Let's do the same
for the recommended posts.

60
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.931
Notice here
that there is no difference,

61
00:03:06.945 --> 00:03:09.194
on how you use
Vuex in your application.

62
00:03:09.473 --> 00:03:11.703
Thus, you can dispatch your actions,

63
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:14.310
and access your getters,
as you are used to do.

64
00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:17.965
Back in the browser,
our post page is working,

65
00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:20.414
this time by utilizing the Vuex store.

66
00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:25.907
Now that we can access the posts
globally in our application,

67
00:03:26.064 --> 00:03:28.505
let's add a link
for each one in the home page.

68
00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:31.322
I will start by adding
a computed property,

69
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.422
that will grab the posts
from the store.

70
00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:39.372
Okay, and now I will loop
through the posts,

71
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:40.983
and create nuxt links.

72
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.954
The to, needs the name of the route,
and the id in the parameters.

73
00:03:54.857 --> 00:03:59.213
I will set the key to the post's id
and keep this button grey glass.

74
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.230
Lastly, I will display the post title.

75
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.091
Looks good,
let's check it out in the browser.

76
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:12.077
Awesome!
We can now navigate to all pages.
