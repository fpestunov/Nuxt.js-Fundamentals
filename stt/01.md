00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.815
Hello people! I am Alex Kyriakidis.

2
00:00:02.898 --> 00:00:06.357
Founder of vueschool.io,
and core member of the Vue.js team.

3
00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:08.710
In this course, we will learn Nuxt.

4
00:00:08.912 --> 00:00:12.569
Nuxt.js is a framework
for creating Vue.js applications.

5
00:00:12.777 --> 00:00:14.975
It's goal is to help Vue developers

6
00:00:15.037 --> 00:00:16.956
take advantage
of top notch technologies,

7
00:00:17.077 --> 00:00:19.837
fast, easy, and in an organized way.

8
00:00:20.022 --> 00:00:23.578
It comes with out of the box support
for server side rendering,

9
00:00:23.668 --> 00:00:27.682
static site generation, meta tags,
code-splitting, and many more.

10
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.213
Let me explain
what these mean for you.

11
00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:34.551
A common problem
in javascript applications,

12
00:00:34.672 --> 00:00:37.437
is that it's hard to deal
with SEO and meta tags.

13
00:00:37.693 --> 00:00:41.404
This is because when we rely
on javascript to fetch our data,

14
00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:45.619
like the content and meta titles,
the page is empty on the initial load.

15
00:00:46.714 --> 00:00:51.488
Also, before javascript is executed,
there is no content to index or parse.

16
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.329
On top of that, many crawlers
do not support javascript.

17
00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:57.399
This means that
if you share an article,

18
00:00:57.487 --> 00:00:59.289
from your javascript blog on Facebook,

19
00:00:59.402 --> 00:01:01.674
it might show up
with a title of undefined,

20
00:01:01.786 --> 00:01:03.787
instead of the actual article's title.

21
00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:07.149
This is where Server Side Rendering
comes to our rescue.

22
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.780
The idea of the SSR
is that you have a server running,

23
00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:12.904
which will create the html response,

24
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.441
and serve it to the client
or the crawler.

25
00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:18.255
So, in the before mentioned example,

26
00:01:18.338 --> 00:01:20.918
the call to the API
would take place on the server,

27
00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:21.935
and when it's done,

28
00:01:22.037 --> 00:01:25.465
the meta data will be set
and the final page will be served.

29
00:01:25.722 --> 00:01:29.242
Thus, all the meta
and SEO information will be in place,

30
00:01:29.337 --> 00:01:31.261
when the crawlers parse the page.

31
00:01:31.492 --> 00:01:35.008
Another benefit of Server
Side Rendering, is the performance.

32
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.186
By rendering the pages on the server,

33
00:01:37.365 --> 00:01:40.761
you can make your application a couple
of hundreds milliseconds faster.

34
00:01:40.922 --> 00:01:42.543
This might not sound like a lot,

35
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:44.800
but when it is true
for every page load,

36
00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:46.180
it is significant.

37
00:01:46.378 --> 00:01:48.699
Both for SEO and user experience.

38
00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.624
Here there is an alternative approach,

39
00:01:51.764 --> 00:01:53.719
that is to pre-render
your application.

40
00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:55.249
With pre-rendering,

41
00:01:55.376 --> 00:01:58.027
instead of having a server
to generate and serve a page,

42
00:01:58.128 --> 00:02:00.183
the pages are generated upfront.

43
00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:04.498
So, your production directory
will contain one html file,

44
00:02:04.604 --> 00:02:06.447
for each page of your application.

45
00:02:06.684 --> 00:02:08.566
The awesomeness of pre-rendering,

46
00:02:08.681 --> 00:02:10.882
is that you can actually
host your project for free,

47
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.100
even when you have a ton of traffic.

48
00:02:13.324 --> 00:02:15.206
Pre-rendering is ideal,

49
00:02:15.326 --> 00:02:17.161
when you are working
with an application,

50
00:02:17.247 --> 00:02:20.040
that has a few pages,
like a personal website.

51
00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.798
Though, you can pre-render
your application,

52
00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:25.326
even when it's consisted
of a lot of pages,

53
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.762
if you want to take advantage
of free hosting.

54
00:02:27.992 --> 00:02:31.356
Lastly, Nuxts takes care
of code-splitting your application.

55
00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:34.052
If you are not familiar
with code-splitting,

56
00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:36.848
it's a technique we use
to split our javascript code,

57
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.518
into multiple files.

58
00:02:38.786 --> 00:02:43.020
The purpose is to make our application
faster and cheaper for the clients.

59
00:02:43.237 --> 00:02:46.498
For instance, an application
might have 100 components,

60
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:48.879
but only use 10 in the home page.

61
00:02:49.187 --> 00:02:51.702
In this case,
the javascript file or bundle,

62
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:52.907
used in the home page,

63
00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:55.983
shouldn't include all the components
that are not used.

64
00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:59.835
Nuxt will automatically create
a javascript file for each page,

65
00:02:59.937 --> 00:03:02.291
and will take care
of the project's dependencies.

66
00:03:02.843 --> 00:03:06.527
Normally, to take advantage
of things like Server Side Rendering,

67
00:03:06.642 --> 00:03:08.250
pre-rendering, and code splitting,

68
00:03:08.342 --> 00:03:10.439
you need to spend
a lot of time making research,

69
00:03:10.518 --> 00:03:12.359
and implementing them on your project.

70
00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:13.549
Well, with Nuxt,

71
00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:17.133
you get those by just enabling
an option in the configuration file.

72
00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.694
During this course,

73
00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.905
we will cover
some major features of Nuxt,

74
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:23.624
and the things that are
different from a vue-cli project.

75
00:03:23.785 --> 00:03:25.465
By the end of the course,

76
00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:27.630
you will be able to create
Nuxt applications,

77
00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:30.418
and use all the techniques
I mentioned in this video.

78
00:03:30.826 --> 00:03:33.951
You don't need any prior
Nuxt experience to follow the course,

79
00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.696
but you need to know Vue.js.

80
00:03:35.835 --> 00:03:38.945
If you are not familiar
with Vue.js and the ecosystem,

81
00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:42.139
check out our other courses,
at vueschool.io.

82
00:03:42.342 --> 00:03:44.736
Ok, let's get to it!
