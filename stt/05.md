00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.216
To create a page
in a Nuxt application,

2
00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:07.663
we have to create a component,
inside the pages directory.

3
00:00:07.895 --> 00:00:09.942
Nuxt will automatically
create the route,

4
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.442
so we don't have to worry
about anything else.

5
00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:14.018
Let's do that.

6
00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:17.559
I will create a post page,
that will display a post.

7
00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:30.443
Let's also use the CSS
we have prepared, in the style tag.

8
00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:31.754
The beauty of Nuxt,

9
00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.579
is that this is all it takes,
to create a new page!

10
00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:36.303
Isn't that awesome?

11
00:00:36.574 --> 00:00:39.990
By the way, if you haven't seen
the article tag before,

12
00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:41.932
it's an HTML 5 element,

13
00:00:42.013 --> 00:00:44.000
that represents
the content of the page,

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.133
like a blog post, a forum thread,

15
00:00:46.223 --> 00:00:48.824
or anything
that can be considered the content.

16
00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:51.302
So, this is not a component.

17
00:00:51.506 --> 00:00:53.308
That's the major reason,

18
00:00:53.377 --> 00:00:56.755
that we recommend you to use
multi-word names for your components,

19
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.381
since there might be HTML tags
that use the same name.

20
00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.525
Ok, we can now browse our new page,
at our website's url/post.

21
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:10.433
Notice here that this page
extends our default layout.

22
00:01:17.106 --> 00:01:19.519
If you are used to working
with vue-cli,

23
00:01:19.643 --> 00:01:22.231
you are familiar with having
a top-level component,

24
00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:23.732
called App.vue.

25
00:01:23.822 --> 00:01:27.732
In Nuxt, the layout components
are like the App.vue.

26
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:29.242
So, for instance,

27
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.951
whatever styling rules
you apply in the layout,

28
00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:34.342
will be applied in all pages
that use it.

29
00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:38.933
Thus, if I set the color
of the h1's to green inside our layout

30
00:01:39.018 --> 00:01:41.611
it will automatically apply
to the post page,

31
00:01:41.708 --> 00:01:43.953
and all the pages
that use this layout.

32
00:01:45.247 --> 00:01:49.619
Ok, I will paste here
the css that Rolf has prepared again.

33
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.008
Keep in mind that is not recommended
to use global styles,

34
00:01:57.128 --> 00:01:59.064
except for architectural element,

35
00:01:59.178 --> 00:02:02.397
like columns,
default fonts and sizes, etc.

36
00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:05.811
Let's see you our application
looks now in our browser.

37
00:02:06.888 --> 00:02:08.004
Cool!

38
00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:09.846
Let me show you something,

39
00:02:09.918 --> 00:02:11.961
before we move on
with the next lesson.

40
00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:15.324
Remember how we talked
about code splitting,

41
00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:16.713
in the introduction video?

42
00:02:16.938 --> 00:02:21.717
This is a great example to showcase
how nuxt has taken care of splitting,

43
00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:23.788
and importing the page components.

44
00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:25.749
While we are on the home page,

45
00:02:25.905 --> 00:02:29.081
you can see in the network
that we have loaded these bundles.

46
00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.998
The post page bundle is not here,

47
00:02:32.163 --> 00:02:35.150
but it will be loaded
when we visit the post page.

48
00:02:35.362 --> 00:02:38.036
One major benefit in that,

49
00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:40.545
is that the users
who only visit the home page,

50
00:02:40.657 --> 00:02:43.284
won't download the code
for the post page.

51
00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:47.573
Also, both pages will load faster
when the network is slow,

52
00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.087
since we load only the code we need.

53
00:02:50.338 --> 00:02:52.906
Imagine how heavy
the network load would be,

54
00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:57.013
if we had 40 pages,
and we loaded all of them, everywhere.
