00:00:02.316 --> 00:00:04.672
Our application
is server side rendered,

00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:07.267
so, in order to deploy it,
we need a server.

00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:10.660
In this lesson, I will show you
how to deploy to Heroku,

00:00:10.797 --> 00:00:12.770
but you can choose
whatever server you like,

00:00:12.893 --> 00:00:14.580
as soon as it can run node.

00:00:14.808 --> 00:00:17.378
You can create
a free account in Heroku,

00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:19.074
if you don't have one already.

00:00:19.244 --> 00:00:23.157
Heroku will charge you by the usage,
so, while experimenting,

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:26.767
or having a really low amount of users
the free tier should be fine.

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:31.716
Let's create a new app.
Give it a name and it's good to go.

00:00:34.674 --> 00:00:38.507
Now, we have a few options
on how to deploy our application here.

00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:42.487
In this video I will use
the git method through the CLI.

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:44.925
If you are storing
your code on github,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.845
you can also connect Heroku
directly with your repository,

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:49.523
and it will deploy automatically,

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:52.162
when you push new code
to your production branch.

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:56.220
To use the Heroku CLI,
you need to install it first.

00:00:56.448 --> 00:00:57.987
That's fairly easy.

00:00:58.082 --> 00:01:00.862
They offer an installer
for mac and windows.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.221
And you can also install it
through brew,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.663
or by running this command in Ubuntu.

00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:09.419
Once you get the cli,
the next step is to login.

00:01:09.613 --> 00:01:12.049
You do that using heroku login.

00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:19.152
In order to deploy through git,
you need to have a git repository.

00:01:19.374 --> 00:01:22.400
If you are not already
using git in your project,

00:01:22.472 --> 00:01:23.893
run this part.

00:01:24.564 --> 00:01:27.564
If you are already in a git repo,
like me,

00:01:27.662 --> 00:01:30.203
all you have to do
is to add the heroku remote,

00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:31.603
using this command.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.022
Now, whenever you push
to the heroku remote,

00:01:36.122 --> 00:01:37.988
the application will be deployed.

00:01:42.298 --> 00:01:45.143
If we try our site now, it won't work.

00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:53.815
Don't worry, that's because we have
to configure a couple of things first.

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:55.781
You can set environment variables,

00:01:55.892 --> 00:01:58.017
in the settings page
of the application.

00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:00.971
You can also set them via the cli.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.134
The nuxt guide provides us
with the necessary variables.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.470
The first one will tell heroku
to also include the dev dependencies

00:02:09.597 --> 00:02:11.791
that are needed for us
to build the application,

00:02:11.884 --> 00:02:13.355
before we start the server.

00:02:13.952 --> 00:02:16.965
Next, we have to set the host
to this one.

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.977
Lastly, we should set
the NODE_ENV to production,

00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:28.353
so nuxt knows
how to properly serve it to the users.

00:02:29.444 --> 00:02:33.646
If you are deploying to another server
you can still consult this page,

00:02:33.772 --> 00:02:36.359
since the configuration
will be pretty much the same.

00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:40.829
Okay, now do you remember
that in order to run our application,

00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:43.748
we need to run the build command first
and then start?

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:47.201
Well, Heroku will automatically
run the start command,

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.495
when it's present.

00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:52.417
Though, we still need to tell Heroku
to build our application first.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.668
To do that, we can add a special
command in the package json file,

00:02:56.745 --> 00:03:00.585
that will tell heroku to run build,
when it's done running its own stuff,

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.529
and has installed
all the dependencies.

00:03:02.796 --> 00:03:05.815
The command name we need here
is the heroku-postbuild,

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:09.114
and the script we want to run
is npm run build.

00:03:09.328 --> 00:03:11.860
I have added a link
in the description,

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.539
if you want to learn more
about deploying to Heroku.

00:03:15.097 --> 00:03:19.249
Now, we have to commit the change
and push it to the Heroku, remote.

00:03:31.287 --> 00:03:34.570
Now, you see the whole process
Heroku is performing.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.877
When it's done, it means
that our application is online!

00:03:39.454 --> 00:03:41.304
That's awesome, right?

00:03:41.528 --> 00:03:45.177
You can add a custom domain
and you are ready to launch it!
