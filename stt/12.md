00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.878
When your application
is ready to go online,

2
00:00:04.956 --> 00:00:08.186
you need to take care
of preparing a production ready build,

3
00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.612
that will minify
you javascript and styles,

4
00:00:10.717 --> 00:00:12.965
hide error details, and so on.

5
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.990
In Nuxt, we can do all these stuff
by running the build command.

6
00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:20.545
When it is complete,

7
00:00:20.622 --> 00:00:23.036
we can serve our production
ready application,

8
00:00:23.108 --> 00:00:24.497
using the start command.

9
00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:28.162
The start command will run a server
that's listening to localhost,

10
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.908
at the port 3.000.

11
00:00:30.077 --> 00:00:31.368
In the browser,

12
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.868
we see that all the bundles
have been uglified.

13
00:00:36.923 --> 00:00:38.675
Ok, these are great.

14
00:00:38.863 --> 00:00:42.401
Now it's about time to make our
application available to the public,

15
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.134
by shipping it to the internet.

16
00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.749
We will do that in the next lesson.
