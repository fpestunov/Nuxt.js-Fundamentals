WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.141 --> 00:00:05.571
As in all websites,
we want to link pages between them.

2
00:00:05.784 --> 00:00:10.220
In Nuxt we create links
using the nuxt-link component.

3
00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.746
If you have experience
with vue router,

4
00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:16.495
know that nuxt-link
is exactly the same with router-link.

5
00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:19.987
To demonstrate this, let's add
a feature to our post component,

6
00:00:20.102 --> 00:00:22.408
that will recommend posts
to the readers.

7
00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:25.251
I will create the relatedPosts
computed property,

8
00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:28.428
that will return all the posts,
except for the active one.

9
00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:38.165
Cool, now in the template
I will create a list,

10
00:00:38.168 --> 00:00:41.796
and display a link
for each related post using an a tag.

11
00:00:54.864 --> 00:00:59.195
The path to browse a post
is /posts/the id.

12
00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.769
Let's give it a shot in the browser.

13
00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:06.695
Yay, our feature works!

14
00:01:06.987 --> 00:01:09.167
Notice though that every time
we hit a link,

15
00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:12.405
the browser reloads
in order to display the new post.

16
00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.684
This shouldn't happen
in a modern Single Page Application.

17
00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.621
To fix this,
and for many other benefits,

18
00:01:18.697 --> 00:01:19.841
that we will explore,

19
00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:23.263
Nuxt provides a component
called nuxt-link.

20
00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:26.867
We can use nuxt link
the exact way we used the a tag,

21
00:01:26.947 --> 00:01:30.273
but instead of href
we will use the to property.

22
00:01:33.938 --> 00:01:35.726
Now, back in the browser,

23
00:01:35.848 --> 00:01:38.703
the navigation still works
and is blazing fast.

24
00:01:38.906 --> 00:01:42.119
Notice that this time
the browser doesn't reload the page.

25
00:01:42.344 --> 00:01:43.397
Great!

26
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:46.095
Let me show you
how I like to create links,

27
00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:48.090
in my vue and nuxt applications.

28
00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:49.706
Instead of passing the path,

29
00:01:49.816 --> 00:01:52.147
you can pass an object
to the to attribute.

30
00:01:52.413 --> 00:01:56.049
In this object you can pass
all sorts of route related stuff,

31
00:01:56.123 --> 00:01:58.063
like the name and the params.

32
00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:04.172
Back in the browser,
everything works as before.

33
00:02:04.372 --> 00:02:05.194
Sweet!

34
00:02:05.787 --> 00:02:07.853
Notice here,
that there is nothing wrong,

35
00:02:07.883 --> 00:02:09.917
in using the path in the to attribute.

36
00:02:10.117 --> 00:02:13.565
I just find using the full object,
clearer and easier to maintain.

37
00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:15.727
Before we jump into the next lesson,

38
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:19.116
let's also fix the Navbar link,
to direct to the home page.

39
00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:31.605
The default name of the Home Page,
is index.

40
00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.344
Excellent.
