00:00:01.944 --> 00:00:04.122
I have opened our new project
in my editor,

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:05.518
to show you around,

3
00:00:05.534 --> 00:00:08.254
and talk a bit
about what each directory is.

4
00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:11.931
The assets directory
contains your uncompiled assets,

5
00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.188
like the SASS files,
images or fonts you might have.

6
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.761
This is the same directory,

7
00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:19.769
that you might have seen
in the vue cli projects.

8
00:00:20.217 --> 00:00:22.676
Next, is the components directory.

9
00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:27.493
This directory is where you will place
your vue.js components.

10
00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:29.010
Nothing new here.

11
00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:32.381
The layout is something
that you might have not seen before,

12
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:35.447
and is used to change
the look and feel of your page.

13
00:00:35.678 --> 00:00:38.118
For example, you can have
a default layout,

14
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.365
and a layout without a sidebar.

15
00:00:40.855 --> 00:00:44.650
The middleware directory
contains your middlewares.

16
00:00:44.852 --> 00:00:47.538
Using middlewares you can define
custom functions,

17
00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:51.497
that can be run before rendering
even a page or a group of pages.

18
00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:53.817
Then, the pages directory,

19
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:56.528
contains your application
views and routes.

20
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.806
Nuxt will read
all the vue files inside this directory,

21
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:02.869
and will automagically
create the application router.

22
00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:06.296
The plugins directory
contains your javascript plugins,

23
00:01:06.472 --> 00:01:09.866
that you want to run before
instantiating the route vue instance.

24
00:01:09.934 --> 00:01:12.384
This is the place
to register components globally,

25
00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:14.664
or to inject functions or constants.

26
00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:19.640
In the static directory
you can place files,

27
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.624
that will automatically be mapped
to the server's root.

28
00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:25.994
This means that
if you put a logo.png here,

29
00:01:26.104 --> 00:01:31.397
you will be able to access it,
under your website's url/logo.png.

30
00:01:31.678 --> 00:01:35.669
Lastly, the store directory,
contains you Vuex Store.

31
00:01:35.935 --> 00:01:39.161
The Vuex Store comes with Nuxt.js
out of the box,

32
00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:41.251
but is disabled by default.

33
00:01:42.827 --> 00:01:46.310
We will go deeper on each directory,
during the course.

34
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:49.205
Know that each directory
includes a readme file,

35
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.020
that you can take a look
and understand how it works.

36
00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:55.699
Also, if you feel that you don't need
some of these features,

37
00:01:55.878 --> 00:01:59.921
like the assets or the store,
you can safely delete the directory.
