When we are working
with dynamic content,

2
00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:04.932
like the posts of a blog,

3
00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:09.163
we need to create a dynamic route,
and get access to an identifier,

4
00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:12.007
like an id,
to know which post to show.

5
00:00:12.475 --> 00:00:15.267
Nuxt takes care
of all these, automagically.

6
00:00:15.454 --> 00:00:19.599
All we have to do is to define
that our page or route is dynamic,

7
00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.363
using the underscore prefix.

8
00:00:21.603 --> 00:00:24.534
For our posts
I will create a posts directory,

9
00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:26.379
and move our component there.

10
00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.918
Now, I will give it a name of _id,

11
00:00:32.035 --> 00:00:36.695
and this way Nuxt will create
all the routes /posts/whatever

12
00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:38.437
direct to our post component,

13
00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:41.887
and give us access to the whatever
though the route params.

14
00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:45.867
I will add some posts to work with,
in our component's data.

15
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.297
Each post has an id,
a title and some content.

16
00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:54.402
Now we need to access the id
that specified in the url,

17
00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:57.179
in order to pick
the corresponding post from our array,

18
00:00:57.238 --> 00:00:58.896
and show it to the users.

19
00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:02.839
The id is exposed
under the route params object.

20
00:01:06.872 --> 00:01:12.527
If we had named our page _username,
then we would have a param username.

21
00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:14.500
Cool!

22
00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:19.119
I will create a computed property post
that will give us the active post.

23
00:01:27.306 --> 00:01:30.069
Let's use it in the template
and we are good to go.

24
00:01:38.387 --> 00:01:40.603
We can now navigate to /posts,

25
00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:42.998
and the id
of the post we want to read.

26
00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:45.843
Let's visit the post
with the id of balut.

27
00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:47.596
Great!

28
00:01:47.803 --> 00:01:51.383
If I change the id to how,
we can read another post.
