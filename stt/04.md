00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.452
The page we see in the browser
is the home page,

2
00:00:04.558 --> 00:00:07.942
that lives in the index.vue file,
in the pages directory.

3
00:00:09.512 --> 00:00:12.063
By default,
it renders the local component,

4
00:00:12.204 --> 00:00:14.924
a couple of headings,
and then a couple of links.

5
00:00:16.173 --> 00:00:18.275
It also comes with some styling.

6
00:00:18.456 --> 00:00:22.209
To customize it a bit,
I will paste some css rules here,

7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.734
that are slightly different
from the defaults.

8
00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:28.278
I always like to have
my component's style scoped,

9
00:00:28.463 --> 00:00:30.187
so, I will do that, as well.

10
00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.561
The beautiful animation
we see in the home page,

11
00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:37.695
is the logo component,
that you can of course overwrite.

12
00:00:37.928 --> 00:00:41.402
Here you can use
a fancy SVG animation, or an image,

13
00:00:41.476 --> 00:00:43.622
if you don't have
an animation, like me.

14
00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:47.238
If you change the logo,
you can also get rid of these styles.

15
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.745
Back in the browser,
we see our customized home page,

16
00:00:51.846 --> 00:00:54.385
that is a bit uglier that the default.
