00:00:02.073 --> 00:00:03.892
To create our Nuxt project,

2
00:00:04.017 --> 00:00:06.442
we will use
the official scaffolding tool.

3
00:00:06.699 --> 00:00:11.484
You can use it via npx or yarn,
by running the command specified here.

4
00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:14.785
Notice here that you don't need
to install any tools,

5
00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.012
in order for these commands to work.

6
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.054
Ok, I use yarn,
so I will open my terminal,

7
00:00:21.203 --> 00:00:23.743
and run yarn create nuxt-app,

8
00:00:23.854 --> 00:00:27.801
and then the name of the project,
which is nuxt-fundamentals.

9
00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:32.403
I will stick
with the default project name,

10
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:34.227
and the default description,

11
00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:38.142
and here we are asked
if we want a custom server framework.

12
00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:41.255
For this course I will stick
to the default nuxt error.

13
00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:44.470
I will also stick with the default UI.

14
00:00:44.732 --> 00:00:47.991
Then we can choose if we want
to go with the universal mode,

15
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.118
or with a single page application.

16
00:00:50.377 --> 00:00:53.491
The universal mode
is an isomorphic application

17
00:00:53.563 --> 00:00:57.184
that comes with server side rendering
and client side navigation.

18
00:00:57.384 --> 00:01:01.855
The Single Page Application mode,
is only the client side navigation,

19
00:01:01.987 --> 00:01:04.402
and it doesn't come
with server side rendering.

20
00:01:04.607 --> 00:01:08.010
In this course, since we will also
talk about server side rendering,

21
00:01:08.108 --> 00:01:10.131
we will go with the universal mode.

22
00:01:10.348 --> 00:01:11.774
I will skip the extras,

23
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.466
and I will choose yarn
as my package manager.

24
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:20.976
Now that the installation is complete,

25
00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:24.677
we can navigate to our project
and run our development server.

26
00:01:27.047 --> 00:01:30.247
Now, we can open our new application
in the browser.

27
00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:35.816
Congrats!
You've made your first nuxt project!
