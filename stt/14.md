00:00:02.262 --> 00:00:03.916
Another cool feature of Nuxt,

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.199
is that it can generate
a static version of your application,

3
00:00:07.338 --> 00:00:09.988
which you can deploy
without the need of a server.

4
00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:13.883
This means that you can host
your application in a service,

5
00:00:13.962 --> 00:00:15.840
like Netlify or GitHub pages,

6
00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:19.232
which are actually free,
even if you have a ton of traffic.

7
00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:20.833
Pretty cool, right?

8
00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:23.391
This is what we call pre-rendering.

9
00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:25.741
And besides of reducing hosting costs,

10
00:00:25.837 --> 00:00:29.727
pre-rendering makes your application
load faster and improves SEO.

11
00:00:30.014 --> 00:00:32.172
Let's see how this works.

12
00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:35.934
To generate the static pages,
we run yarn generate,

13
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:37.968
or npm run generate.

14
00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.991
This command
will generate an .html file,

15
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.236
for each page we have in our project.

16
00:00:44.457 --> 00:00:47.352
The produced files
live in the dist directory.

17
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.280
In here, we should have
one folder for each route,

18
00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.783
where each folder
includes an index.html file.

19
00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:57.585
Unfortunately, we don't,
but we will talk about that later.

20
00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:01.469
We have the root index.html file,
which is our home page.

21
00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.125
We can open it
in the browser directly,

22
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.405
without running a server
in the background.

23
00:01:06.702 --> 00:01:09.051
Sweet!
But where are the post pages?

24
00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:13.910
Well, Nuxt might be magical
but even magic has some limits.

25
00:01:14.168 --> 00:01:15.944
Our post route is dynamic,

26
00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:18.660
so we have to create
one file for each post.

27
00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:21.639
If your application
doesn't have dynamic routes,

28
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.979
at this point
you are ready to host it.

29
00:01:24.287 --> 00:01:28.719
In order for Nuxt to know which
dynamic pages we need to generate,

30
00:01:28.852 --> 00:01:32.115
we have to specify the routes
in the nuxt configuration file.

31
00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:34.905
The property is called generate,

32
00:01:34.952 --> 00:01:38.348
and along with other options,
it accepts an array with the routes.

33
00:01:39.268 --> 00:01:41.947
We are using the post ids
to define the routes,

34
00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.576
so our paths here will be
/posts/ the id,

35
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.951
where the ids are balut,
whereIsIt, and how.

36
00:01:50.712 --> 00:01:51.817
Great!

37
00:01:52.043 --> 00:01:54.942
If you need to create this array
for lot's of dynamic routes,

38
00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:57.306
you can run asynchronous code
in this file,

39
00:01:57.443 --> 00:02:00.740
and set the routes based on the data
coming from your API.

40
00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:03.531
We will cover this in depth
in another course.

41
00:02:03.786 --> 00:02:07.006
Okay, for our example,
this is just fine.

42
00:02:07.284 --> 00:02:09.468
Let's run yarn generate again.

43
00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:15.874
Now we can see here
that Nuxt has generated a file,

44
00:02:15.978 --> 00:02:18.019
or a folder, for each route we need.

45
00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:21.020
All these live in the dist directory.

46
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.019
If we open one of the files,

47
00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:25.074
you can see
that everything works great.

48
00:02:28.237 --> 00:02:30.429
Now, it's about time to deploy it.

49
00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:32.353
There are many services out there,

50
00:02:32.544 --> 00:02:34.704
and for this video
I have chosen my favorite,

51
00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:35.988
which is netlify.

52
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.749
In order to deploy netlify,
of course you need to have an account.

53
00:02:41.943 --> 00:02:44.776
Know that static hosting
on Netlify, is free.

54
00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:48.549
To deploy to netlify,
we need to have a git repository.

55
00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.277
Here, we are asked to pick
our git provider.

56
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.139
For me that's GitHub.

57
00:02:53.263 --> 00:02:56.685
Ok, at this point you need
to give it access to the repository.

58
00:02:56.974 --> 00:02:58.744
I have skipped this step in the video,

59
00:02:58.868 --> 00:03:01.207
so you guys
don't see my secret repositories.

60
00:03:01.401 --> 00:03:03.990
Once you connect your account,
you will see this page,

61
00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:06.497
where you have to specify
the build command.

62
00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.722
This command is the one
we run in the terminal,

63
00:03:09.828 --> 00:03:12.181
in order to generate the html files.

64
00:03:12.456 --> 00:03:14.438
So, yarn generate.

65
00:03:14.684 --> 00:03:18.082
The publish directory
is where the static files live.

66
00:03:18.378 --> 00:03:19.883
Thus, our dist directory.

67
00:03:21.357 --> 00:03:23.429
Once I will fill this,
I will hit deploy.

68
00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.634
And as you can see,
the deploy is in progress.

69
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.962
When this is done,
our website is live!

70
00:03:33.198 --> 00:03:34.398
Yes!

71
00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:37.506
Notice that you can enable
automatic deployments,

72
00:03:37.624 --> 00:03:39.043
so, your website updates,

73
00:03:39.154 --> 00:03:41.236
every time you push
to your production branch.

74
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.993
Okay guys, that was it.

75
00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:45.752
I hope you enjoyed the course,

76
00:03:45.887 --> 00:03:48.503
and can't wait to see
what you will build with Nuxt.

77
00:03:48.754 --> 00:03:52.753
