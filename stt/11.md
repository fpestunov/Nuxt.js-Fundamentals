If you have experience
with javascript applications,

2
00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:07.001
you already know
how cumbersome it can be,

3
00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:09.007
to make your pages SEO friendly,

4
00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:12.212
and make the links you publish
on social media look good.

5
00:00:13.143 --> 00:00:14.491
As you might have heard,

6
00:00:14.557 --> 00:00:17.834
Nuxt is great for SEO
and working with meta tags.

7
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:21.723
That's because the application
can be rendered on the server side,

8
00:00:21.802 --> 00:00:25.764
so when the crawlers read a page,
is has already been processed,

9
00:00:25.863 --> 00:00:28.081
and the meta information
has been appended.

10
00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.326
This feature is very simple to use.

11
00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:33.039
What we have to do
is to use the head method,

12
00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:34.451
in our page components,

13
00:00:34.538 --> 00:00:37.885
to set the HTML Head tags
for the current page.

14
00:00:38.073 --> 00:00:40.989
Right now,
both the home page and the post,

15
00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:43.287
have this title of nuxt-fundamentals.

16
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.352
Let's change that.
I will start with the home page.

17
00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:50.334
Here, I will use
the head method I mentioned,

18
00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:52.743
and I will set the title to Home Page.

19
00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:58.692
The head method looks the same
with the data.

20
00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.953
It is a function that returns
an object with the content.

21
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:04.114
Let's check it out in the browser.

22
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.470
Nice!

23
00:01:07.657 --> 00:01:10.085
I will move on with the post page.

24
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.537
Here we could say post page,

25
00:01:14.622 --> 00:01:18.438
but it would be so much nicer
to show the title of the active post.

26
00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:21.191
We can do that with no hassle,

27
00:01:21.267 --> 00:01:24.180
by accessing
the component's data under this.

28
00:01:25.148 --> 00:01:26.794
Now, in the browser,

29
00:01:26.897 --> 00:01:29.808
the tab name changes
as we browse through the posts.

30
00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:30.985
This is great!

31
00:01:31.827 --> 00:01:35.135
In the same way we can set
the description of each page,

32
00:01:35.214 --> 00:01:36.862
the keywords, and so on.

33
00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.553
I will move on with the meta tags.

34
00:01:39.796 --> 00:01:42.897
Since they are many,
we use an array to define them.

35
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.799
The meta tags might be dozens,

36
00:01:44.836 --> 00:01:47.112
depending on the networks
you are targeting.

37
00:01:47.237 --> 00:01:50.540
For this video I will fix the ones
that are needed for Twitter.

38
00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:54.156
If you want to optimize
for Facebook or other platforms,

39
00:01:54.192 --> 00:01:57.292
you just have to find the meta names
and set them here.

40
00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:59.357
So, the twitter:title,

41
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.250
should be the text we want
the link to have when shared.

42
00:02:05.805 --> 00:02:08.116
Next we can have
a twitter:description.

43
00:02:11.428 --> 00:02:14.050
I will set this one
to the content of the post.

44
00:02:14.712 --> 00:02:17.536
We can also specify
the image for the card.

45
00:02:18.635 --> 00:02:22.439
Since our posts don't have images,
I will use our logo.

46
00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:25.937
Twitter also has this unique meta
called card,

47
00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.882
that's used to specify
the size of the shared image.

48
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.511
I will set it to summary_large_image.

49
00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:40.464
Ok, looks good.
Let's do the same for the home page.

50
00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.362
Here, I will just hardcode some values.

51
00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.047
Now, we can't actually test
our work on Twitter,

52
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.666
since we haven't deployed
our application yet,

53
00:02:55.805 --> 00:02:58.396
but we can ensure
that what we did works,

54
00:02:58.517 --> 00:03:01.210
by inspecting the head
of the document in the browser.

55
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.658
In the next lessons
we will deploy our application,

56
00:03:07.778 --> 00:03:10.130
so we will get the chance
to actually test,

57
00:03:10.176 --> 00:03:12.728
how our links look like on Twitter.
