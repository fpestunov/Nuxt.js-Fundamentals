00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:04.327
When you want to use an element
that will be present in all pages,

2
00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:08.102
like a navbar or a sidebar,
the layout is the place to put it.

3
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:12.399
The nuxt component will render
the contents of the active page.

4
00:00:12.627 --> 00:00:15.555
To add a navbar on top
we can place it here.

5
00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.247
Though, it's always nice
to create a component,

6
00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.021
so we keep our files simple
and reusable.

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.567
So, if we create another layout later,

8
00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:29.588
we will be able
to just import the navbar component,

9
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:30.832
and drop it in.

10
00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:36.237
Ok, I will create a component
that I will name TheNavbar,

11
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:38.925
since we will always have
only one instance.

12
00:00:39.112 --> 00:00:40.687
Let's add some markup,

13
00:00:40.742 --> 00:00:43.348
and paste the css
we have prepared in the style.

14
00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.921
Because we haven't talked
about nuxt links yet,

15
00:00:55.977 --> 00:00:58.241
I added this dead link
in the navbar,

16
00:00:58.317 --> 00:01:00.520
that we will fix soon
in another video.

17
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.882
Back to the layout component,

18
00:01:02.997 --> 00:01:06.881
we can import the navbar and render it
just before the nuxt tag.

19
00:01:21.922 --> 00:01:25.547
Now, in the browser,
the navbar show up in all pages.

20
00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:26.899
Great!
