## Create Nuxt App

https://nuxtjs.org/guide/installation

Nuxt.js has an official scaffolding tool (create-nuxt-app), that you can use from your package manager.

In this lesson, we will use yarn to set up our new Nuxt.js project, with this command:
```
yarn create nuxt-app nuxt-fundamentals
```

Settings:
- Rendering Mode = Universal
- Package Manager = Yarn

You can also use npx (´npx´ is shipped by default since NPM ´5.2.0´)
```
npx create-nuxt-app nuxt-fundamentals
```

Install Yarn `npm install -g yarn`
